## Background




The Social Sciences Building at the University of New Mexico (UNM) plays a pivotal role in shaping the academic experience for students and faculty alike. Opened in 1987, this modernist structure was designed by the renowned architectural firm Hutchinson, Brown and Partners. Located at the heart of UNM’s central campus, the building is home to various departments, including Sociology, Political Science, and Anthropology. It serves as a central hub for the study and exploration of human societies, cultures, and political systems, providing students with the necessary resources to engage in critical thinking and interdisciplinary research.
The design of the Social Sciences Building reflects a blend of functional design and regional aesthetic, with its clean lines and open spaces complementing the Southwestern architectural style that defines much of UNM’s campus. Its layout was carefully planned to foster collaboration, with classrooms, lecture halls, and faculty offices arranged to encourage interaction among students and faculty. The building's proximity to other academic facilities ensures that it is a focal point for intellectual engagement, while its proximity to outdoor spaces provides a relaxing environment for reflection and informal discussion.
Throughout the years, the Social Sciences Building has witnessed countless academic milestones, serving as the backdrop for significant research, lectures, and academic events. It is not just a building but a symbol of the university’s ongoing commitment to education, scholarship, and social change. As a place where students and scholars come together to explore pressing social issues, the building continues to inspire dialogue, growth, and an enduring pursuit of knowledge

## Construction
The School of Social Sciences and the Graduate School of Management at the University of New Mexico were planned as three-story buildings, with the School of Management including a full basement extending 10 to 15 feet below the existing ground level. The basement was designed to reach beyond the building’s above-ground footprint on the south side. The School of Social Sciences would have a slab-on-grade first floor at an elevation of 5,162 feet, while the Graduate School of Management's basement would sit at an elevation around 5,145 feet. Interestingly, the first floor of the Social Sciences building was to be constructed just 5 feet from an existing utility tunnel, and its second floor would include a balcony extending over that tunnel. Structural engineers expected moderate loads, with maximum column loads reaching about 320 kips (or 320,000 pounds) for the Management Building and 170 kips for the Social Sciences Building. The entire project began with a geotechnical investigation by Sergent, Hauskins & Beckwith to analyze the site’s soil and subsoil conditions and provide recommendations for foundation and slab design.

## Construction Cost
The total construction cost for the combined project—including the School of Social Sciences, the Graduate School of Management, the Anderson School of Management, and Economics facilities—ultimately reached $6,619,000, with an additional $310,851 added later through change orders. This brought the total project cost to $6,929,851. The costs included $3.2 million for the Graduate School of Management, $2.8 million for the School of Social Sciences, $400,000 for renovations to the Anderson School of Management, and $500,000 for the Economics facility. The increase from the original estimate reflected the project's growing complexity and changing academic requirements.
